# Installing TagoCore

:::info
To install TagoCore, you need to [Download it](/download) first.
:::

## Decompressing

TagoCore code can be downloaded either as a compressed `tar.gz` file or a compressed `zip` file, and in both cases you need to decompress the code before using TagoCore.

### .tar.gz

If you have downloaded TagoCore compressed as a **.tar.gz** file, you need to execute a couple of commands before running the application.
Open a terminal in the folder where you downloaded TagoCore and execute the following command:

```shell
tar -xvzf community_images.tar.gz
```

This command uses the `tar` command from unix to decompress the `.tar.gz` file in the current directory. 

### .zip

If you have downloaded TagoCore compressed as a **.zip** file, you need to execute a couple of commands before running the application.
Open a terminal in the folder where you downloaded TagoCore and execute the following command:

```shell
unzip file.zip
```

This command uses the `zip` command to decompress the `.zip` file in the current directory. 

## Executing TagoCore

After you decompress the downloaded code, you may execute the following command to execute the TagoCore:

```shell
just install
just build-console
just server
```

As soon as TagoCore runs, it will open a webserver and output the URL of the server in the terminal:

```shell
TagoCore is now available at http://localhost:8888
```

That's it! Access the URL in your browser and start building your applications.
