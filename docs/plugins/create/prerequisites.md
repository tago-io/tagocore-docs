# Prerequisites

TagoCore Plugins are built using Node.js and the [TagoCore Plugin SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/@tago-io/tcore-sdk).
Youâ€™ll need an understanding of **JavaScript** and **Node.js** to develop plugins.

While it is not necessary, other tools may come in handy when developing more complex plugins. You don't need to learn 
these tools before starting to write plugins, but they may be useful at some point.

- [TypeScript](https://npmjs.com/package/typescript), to make navigating the API easier and write robust plugins;
- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) or [Esbuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild), to bundle large
multi-file projects;
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE, to accelerate the development of your Plugin.

You do **not** need to have experience with front-end UI libraries such as React or Vue. TagoCore creates and manages
your Plugin's user interface via a JSON structure.

:::info Important
You should use **Node.js version 14** or greater to build plugins for TagoCore.
