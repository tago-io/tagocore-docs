# Activate plugin via Store

All plugins in the store are inside plugins, meaning the plugin code is already included in TagoCore. Therefore, you don't need to install them, you only need to activate them.

To activate a plugin from the Plugin Store, simply follow these steps:

- Click the `Store` button located in the TagoCore's sidebar.
- Select the Plugin you want to activate;
- Click on `Activate` in the right side of the page to activate the Plugin.

:::info Good to know
You won't be able to activate a Plugin that is not compatible with your Platform.
