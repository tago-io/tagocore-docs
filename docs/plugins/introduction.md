# Plugins

Plugins are programs or applications created by the community and TagoIO that extend the functionality of TagoCore.

## Creating a plugin

All TagoCore plugins are created using Node.js and soon you will be able to publish your Plugin to the world by using
our Plugin Store.

Read our [Creating Plugins](/plugins/create) article to starting creating your own Plugins.

## Installing a plugin

If you have developed your own Plugin, you may be looking for a way to install it in TagoCore. If that's the case,
check out our [Manual installation](/plugins/install/manually) guide.

However, if you are trying to install Plugins from other developers, the best way is via the
[Plugin Store](/plugins/install/pluginstore).
