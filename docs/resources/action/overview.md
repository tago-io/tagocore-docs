# Action

Action is a very powerful feature that gives you total control over your [Devices](/device) based on events determined by you.

With Actions you can:

- Run scripts using an [Analysis](/analysis);
- Make HTTP POST requests to endpoints;
- Use [triggers](/action/trigger) and [types](/action/type) from Plugins;
- And much more in the future.


## Adding an Action

To add a new Action, press the&nbsp; <img className="inline-image" src="/docs/img/action/add-action-button.png" height="25px" /> &nbsp;button on the **Actions** page. Once you press the button, the **Add Action** modal will appear for you to insert a new action:

<img className="big-image" src="/docs/img/action/add-action-modal.png" height="300px" />

In this modal, you must define a name, a [trigger](/action/trigger), and a [type](/action/type).
