# Bucket

Bucket is where the data from your [Devices](/device) is stored. You may create as many buckets as you wish. We recommend you create one bucket for each device to make it easier to find and keep control of the data. However, one bucket may be linked to more than one device.

:::info
When a [Device](/device) is created, TagoCore automatically creates a Bucket for it with the same name.

## Adding a Bucket

To add a new Bucket, press the&nbsp; <img className="inline-image" src="/docs/img/bucket/add-bucket-button.png" height="25px" /> &nbsp;button on the **Buckets** page. Once you press the button, the **Add Bucket** modal will appear for you to insert a new bucket:

<img className="big-image" src="/docs/img/bucket/add-bucket-modal.png" height="400px" />

In this modal, you must define a name and you can optionally define a [data retention](/bucket/data-retention) period for the [data](/bucket/data) in your Bucket.
