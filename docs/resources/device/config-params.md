# Configuration Parameters

Configuration Parameters are key-value pairs that can be retrieved and sent by a device. Think of them as environment variables that can be fetched from your physical device in order for your device to behave differently.

You can mark parameters as `read` in order to filter out parameters during the retrieval.
